# Atomic Bomberman Launcher

An small update to the now abandoned launcher by the original developer on http://ablauncher.sourceforge.net/.

Since he seemed to abandon the code, I took it to update a few things here and there.


## What you should know:

- The program writes the path to the config file (cfg.ini, hdhome=, cdhome=)
- The program writes IPX as default protocol (options.ini, netprotocol=1)


## Post notes:

Why I didn't care to push to his SVN? Because SVN & SourceForge can go to hell.
